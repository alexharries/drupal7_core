# greyhead_drupal7

Greyhead Drupal is a Drupal 7 installation which detects its environment - e.g. local, dev, staging or live - and uses different configurations - e.g. caching on or off, emails redirected to Watchdog, etc - depending on the environment.

This code is very much work-in-progress and should be avoided if met in a darkened alley at night time in a shady part of town...
